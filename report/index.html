          <h2>UN Sustainable Development Goal</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">
            The objective of goal 12 is to ensure sustainable consumption of our resources. We are currently using more natural resources than which are available. Our population keeps growing and in turn our consumption increases. Our current planet is not able to sustain the ever growing demand that we put on it. 
            <br><br>About 1/3 of all food that is produced gets wasted. We wanted to focus on these issues and take a look at the food we consume and what kind of effects it has on the planet. We realised that a lot of food gets wasted, food that in many cases are perfectly edible but are thrown away because of our picky habits.

          <h2>Food Waste Issue</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">
              “In agriculture in Sweden, about 300,000 tonnes of raw material is produced per year, which was intended for food but which does not go on to food. One of the reasons for this is the market's quality requirements, in the later stages of the chain and among us consumers. “ 
              <br><a href="http://www.jordbruksverket.se/amnesomraden/miljoklimat/matsvinn.4.4b00b7db11efe58e66b8000996.html" target="_blank">the Swedish Board of Agriculture</a>
          <br> <br>
            “The production of the amount of food thrown every year corresponds to emissions of about 2 million tons of carbon dioxide, which is about 3 percent of the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions in Sweden.”

          <h2>Ideating</h2>
          <p class="lead mb-0">
              Through the ideation session we worked with the key topics and issues we had identified through our research. These issues were food waste and production shortcomings where we sketched and thought through possible ways to make these topics into speculative design. From the ideation we had a couple ideas that we decided to work further on. 
              <br><br>Some of these ideas were VR glasses that would guide you through the store and change the way products look, giving you a false perspective of what you are buying. Another was a way to alter the way your food looks, similarly using ”ugly” food and making it look fresh and nice. From the critique session we got valuable feedback and we were able to narrow it down to an app that could alter the way your fruit looks from unfresh to very fresh, in order to harvest "Likes" on social media.

            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-0">
              We discussed what we wanted our app to do and what message we wanted to get across to our audience. We wireframed together and decided on an application that focused on editing images for social media. An app where people can take less appealing fruit images and make them look beautiful. The purpose being to harvest more likes from their peers as well as portray a better version of their reality.  
              <br>
              Our second iteration was based on user testing in which they wanted it to be cleaner and more open ended. Some users felt the extreme color choices distracted from the image they were supposed to edit. Others didn’t appreciate being forced into one path only, they wanted to explore the app but this iteration forced them to complete one journey without the possibility of exploring more options. 
              <br>
              For our third iteration, we wanted to make our message more obvious by connecting food waste to our social media, photo editing app. We felt that a newsfeed where other people’s images are displayed, not only link our app in reality as well as gives us a platform to include text that talk about our topic. Displaying that others are also using the app and posting their best fruit pics as well anchors it in reality. We also wanted to give them more options to explore the app with four possible journey paths.

            <h2>User Testing</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-0">
              We implemented different methodologies within our user testing. We conducted interviews, observations of user testing our app, and “card sorting” (banana sorting). We interviewed people in Gädden. We showed them the app with the promotional website and had them interact with both. We tried to provide as little information as possible about the meaning of the app so that they could try and figure it out for themselves. We showed them the app and went through our intended flow.  Most people quickly tapped through our intended journey. Our intention was that people would stop and try out every step thoroughly rather than quickly moving though the different steps. 
              Overall the interviews gave us great feedback and pointed out things to work on for the next iteration of the app. 
              <br>
              We user tested our app with someone not aware of critical or speculative design. The user had a hard time understanding the purpose of the app and initially saw it as a sarcastic app trying to mock the fact that people over edit most of their photos or even go as far as editing pictures of babies.
               <br> 
               For the second user test we let people sort three different bananas according to our questions. One banana was quite ripe, another one lightly spotted and one over ripened banana. The questions ranged between sorting the bananas in order of most photogenic, most appetizing, which would you give or bake with. We got similar answers and most people prefer green bananas. There were however some deviations in the answers. While some answers were obvious it still gave us insights to work off.

            <h2>Insights</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-0">
              Our interviews were mostly with Students in Gäddan and with older adults at Saluhall. We noticed that with students, they did not concern themselves as much with food waste in relation to the environmental impact, but their main focus was on their economy. Because they have limited financial resources, they saw food waste as harmful to their wallet. Both segments did not concern themselves with how their food waste impacts the environment but rather cared about how the food tastes.
               <br>
               One person interpreted our app as a critique towards social media and how companies over exaggerate their products to make them look much bigger and better than what they are.  She also didn't like our logo or name saying it was confusing due to the way the logo was spelled out and how it has a different pronounciation in swedish and english. 
              <br> From using the app users understood that it was an editing tool for fruit. The interpretation however, was different from our intentions. We had to go into great detail about our concept for them to understand what the idea was all about. 
                <br>
                The most interesting insight gathered from the card sorting session was the general attitude towards the brown banana. People showed little care towards it and would neither eat, use, or purchase it. One person did express that you could use it for cooking and that he would prioritize the brown banana when making food. 
                Another insight was that regardless of taste the most ideal image of a banana was the ripe one and everyone prefered the look of it. It's the one we would generally regard as the most fresh and pretty one. 
                <br>
                <br>
                We need to be very clear and careful to not be over the top obvious with our topic but also make sure we get our point across to our audience. One of the most difficult aspects of this project was trying to change people's perspectives and get our points across to them in a positive and understanding way.
